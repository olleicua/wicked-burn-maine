    <h3>Ticket Lottery</h3>
    <p>
      The ticket lottery is closed but you can still join the waitlist by following the instructions below. <span class="important">If you are not planning to attend please return your ticket for a full refund as early as possible so that folks can move up the waitlist.</span>
    </p>
    <h3>Signup Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You will be prompted to create an account or log in. If you have been to <a href="https://www.fireflyartscollective.org/" target="_blank">Firefly</a> or <a href="https://www.nectrct.org/" target="_blank">NECTR</a> before then you may already have an account in which case you can simply log in.
      </li>
      <li>
        You will be asked how much you want to pay for your ticket. Ticket sales help us provide essential infrastructure, and will help us provide art grants in the future. Tickets (regardless of your age) are pay-what-you-can. $0 is acceptible, $45 is suggested, more than $45 helps us make the burn even more amazing next year.
      </li>
      <li>
        You will be asked to sign a waiver.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you get a ticket, you will be asked to sign up for two volunteer shifts which you will be able to manage at <a href="https://participate.wickedburn.social/" target="_blank">participate.wickedburn.social</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you plan to drive to the burn (as apposed to car-pooling) you will need a parking pass (which are in limited supply) and you will have an opportunity to purchase one for $15 after purchasing your ticket.
      </li>
