    <h3>Ticket Lottery</h3>
    <p>
      Wicked Burn tickets will be made available via a lottery. If you would like to attend please follow the instructions below to sign up for the lottery <b>between March 22nd and April 5th</b>. On April 6th we will randomly determine who gets offered a chance to purchase a ticket. If you don't get into the lottery on April 6th, you will be placed on the waitlist in a random order. If you sign up after April 6th you will be placed at the end of the waitlist. If, after purchasing a ticket, you decide not to attend the burn for any reason prior to May 11th you can return your ticket for a refund. <span class="important">If you are not planning to attend please return your ticket as early as possible so that folks can move up the waitlist.</span>
