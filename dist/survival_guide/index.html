      When packing your food to bring along, remove any packaging (boxes, bags, etc) before you come to eliminate waste.

    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Volunteer</b>
      <br />
      This event is yours to make it what it will be. We need you to help in every aspect of this event.  Set up, take down, portos, build, etc, etc. The more volunteers the easier the task for each will be. If you've already bought your ticket make sure to sign up for two volunteer shifts be going to <a href="http://participate.wickedburn.social" target="_blank">participate.wickedburn.social</a> (you may need to log in).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>When You Arrive</b>
      <br />
      You will need to show a legal ID for each participant in your car. If the name on your ID doesn't match a ticket holder on our list then your car will be turned away. Once you have checked in you will be asked to unload all of your camping gear at the gate and directed to park accross the street. Unload everything you will need as you will not be able to access your vehicle during the event.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>No Re-entry</b>
      <br />
      There is no re-entry to the event from noon on Friday to noon Monday. If you leave the event of your own accord during those times, you will not be readmitted. This includes going to the parking lot which is considered leaving the event!  Practice radical self-sufficiency and be prepared with enough water, food, and supplies for the duration of the event. If you forget something, your best bet is to ask someone if they can help you out!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We have these rules in place to protect you and our neighbours.  Vehicles often drive very fast in the area and we don't want to see anyone get hurt crossing the road!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Exceptions to the no re-entry policy require approval. If you have an emergency and need to leave the event or visit the parking lot, talk to the people at the gate (or Officer of the Day if it is after hours) and they will work with you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Children</b>
      <br />
      If bringing someone under the age of 18 they will need their own ticket. The minor will need their Legal ID or photo of birth certificate reflecting you as their parent or legal guardian. Please be responsible for your littles, and present for their needs. The burn is not your babysitter!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Label Everything</b>
      <br />
      Personalize your phone and personal items with a label with your name, contact, etc. Take a picture of yourself to put on your lock screen (easy way to find you).
