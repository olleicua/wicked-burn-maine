    <h3>Event Policies</h3>
    
    <p>
      The following policies apply to both our work weekends and our main burn event. If you plan to attend either please read this entire page.
      <br />
      <br />
      <u>IMPORTANT:</u> by attending our work weekends or events you agree to abide by these policies as well as the waiver linked at the bottom of this page as well as to our <a href="/code_of_conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>LNT</b>
      <br />
      Leave No Trace — Pack it In, Pack it out — Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
      <br />
      Clean up after yourselves. Take your trash with you to dispose of properly, off site.
      Pick up any MOOP (Matter out of place) you may see. 
      When packing your food to bring along, remove any packaging (boxes, bags, etc) before you come to eliminate waste.
      Gray water should be screened and then dumped at least 100 feet from water, all other food waste should be packed out.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>When You Arrive</b>
      <br />
      You will need to show a legal ID for each participant in your car. If the name on your ID doesn't match a ticket holder on our list then your car will be turned away. Once you have checked in you will be asked to unload all of your camping gear at the gate and directed to park accross the street. Unload everything you will need as you will not be able to access your vehicle during the event.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>No Re-entry</b>
      <br />
      There is no re-entry to the event from noon on Friday to noon Monday. If you leave the event of your own accord during those times, you will not be readmitted. This includes going to the parking lot which is considered leaving the event!  Practice radical self-sufficiency and be prepared with enough water, food, and supplies for the duration of the event. If you forget something, your best bet is to ask someone if they can help you out!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We have these rules in place to protect you and our neighbours.  Vehicles often drive very fast in the area and we don't want to see anyone get hurt crossing the road!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Exceptions to the no re-entry policy require approval. If you have an emergency and need to leave the event or visit the parking lot, talk to the people at the gate (or Officer of the Day if it is after hours) and they will work with you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Children</b>
      <br />
      If bringing someone under the age of 18 they will need their own ticket. The minor will need their Legal ID or photo of birth certificate reflecting you as their parent or legal guardian. Please be responsible for your littles, and present for their needs. The burn is not your babysitter!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Driving on trails policy</b>
      <br />
      Only During Build Day / Exodus / Emergencies. This includes golf-carts, ATVs, and bicycles.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Fire Policies</b>
      <br />

      <br />
      Fire performers must get liability insurance that names Wicked Maine Arts Society as additionally insured.

    </p>
    
    <p>
