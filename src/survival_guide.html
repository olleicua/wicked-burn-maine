  <br />
  Leave No Trace — Pack it In, Pack it out — Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
  <br />
  Clean up after yourselves. Take your trash with you to dispose of properly, off site.
  Pick up any MOOP (Matter out of place) you may see. 
  When packing your food to bring along, remove any packaging (boxes, bags, etc) before you come to eliminate waste.
  Gray water should be screened and then dumped at least 100 feet from water, all other food waste should be packed out.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Volunteer</b>
  <br />
  This event is yours to make it what it will be. We need you to help in every aspect of this event.  Set up, take down, portos, build, etc, etc. The more volunteers the easier the task for each will be. If you've already bought your ticket make sure to sign up for two volunteer shifts be going to <a href="http://participate.wickedburn.social" target="_blank">participate.wickedburn.social</a> (you may need to log in).
</p>

<p>
  <b>When You Arrive</b>
  <br />
  You will need to show a legal ID for each participant in your car. If the name on your ID doesn't match a ticket holder on our list then your car will be turned away. Once you have checked in you will be asked to unload all of your camping gear at the gate and directed to park accross the street. Unload everything you will need as you will not be able to access your vehicle during the event.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Children</b>
  <br />
  If bringing someone under the age of 18 they will need their own ticket. The minor will need their Legal ID or photo of birth certificate reflecting you as their parent or legal guardian. Please be responsible for your littles, and present for their needs. The burn is not your babysitter!
</p>

<p>
  <b>Label Everything</b>
  <br />
  Personalize your phone and personal items with a label with your name, contact, etc. Take a picture of yourself to put on your lock screen (easy way to find you).
