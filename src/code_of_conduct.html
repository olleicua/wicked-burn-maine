<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

<h4>Consent</h4>

<p>
  Our event fosters an environment of consent as a foundational aspect of everything that happens at Wicked Burn. While consent is generally spoken about in terms of sexual activity, it extends beyond this at Wicked Burn and can include things such as any physical touch, entering a camp's private spaces, taking photographs of others and their art, taking/removing people's belongings from their spaces, and generally respecting one another's boundaries without persuasion or coercion.
</p>

<p>
  Consent can only be given when it is given freely. Consent is also reversable, and can be taken back at any time. Consent should be informed–people should be disclosed to completely so they are able to make a decision. Consent should be enthusiastic–anything less is a NO. Finally, Consent is specific–and limits of consenting behaviors should be respected. 
</p>

<p>
  Remember <b>FRIES</b>–<b>F</b>reely-given, <b>R</b>eversible, <b>I</b>nformed, <b>E</b>nthusiastic, <b>S</b>pecific
</p>

<p>
  <u>Some examples of where informed and enthusiastic consent should be considered include:</u>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Touch:</b> Just because you hugged someone yesterday doesn't mean you can surprise them with a hug today. "Surprise contact" isn't always wanted, even if it's affectionate. Touch includes bodies and things.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Kink:</b> Consent for one thing isn't consent for another. If I said you can spank me, that doesn't give you permission to grope me.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Sex:</b> Consent can be revoked once it's been given.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Gifts:</b> Disclose what is in your gifts, even if it's just essential oils. Some people have sensitivities
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Foods:</b> Disclose the ingredients, one person's innocuous ingredient can be someone else's allergy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Photography:</b> Ask before taking pictures. Remember consent to take a picture is NOT consent to post it on your blog.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Ground Scores:</b> Before claiming something as "found" first ensure it isn't "lost". MOOP (matter out of place) can sometimes be accidental and our best efforts should be made to return people's belongings to them. Please return found items to the Center Camp lost and found area so folks can be reunited with their belongings.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <u>The following is Wicked Burn's stance on consent and “best practices” for protecting yourself and others:</u>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>NO</b> always means <b>NO</b>. <b>Only YES</b> means <b>YES</b>. Get an enthusiastic YES before proceeding with anything that might infringe on someone else's boundaries. After someone has said NO, cajoling, pleading, or any form of emotional blackmail is UNACCEPTABLE.
  </li>
  <li>
    YES can turn into a NO at any time, and that needs to be respected. You or the other person don't have to go along with something, even if it was previously agreed on. If you change your mind, speak up! If someone else changes their mind, act in accordance with that new boundary.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before you assume someone wants your attention, ASK. Being direct is OK. This includes anything from casual touch, hugs, spankings, kissing, etc. Some people do not want to be touched, respect that. Asking is expected protocol, not the exception.
  </li>
  <li>
    Respect the moment. Comfort levels vary at different times and with different people. Even if a person seems comfortable with one person touching them does not mean they are ok with everyone touching them. If you're not sure if what you're about to do is ok, either where you are, or who you are with, ask. Not everything is a good idea everywhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    Being under the influence is not an excuse for infringing on others' boundaries. Consider your level of sobriety. Are you able to ask permission and respect others' boundaries? Consider the other person's level of sobriety. Are they able to give consent? TIP: Not sure? Wait! You can wait until you both have your full judgment
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Self Expression</h4>

<p>
  Wicked Burn seeks to foster an environment of creative self-expression, where attendees feel supported to honestly express themselves through artistic creations, performance, and in their social interactions. Self expression is important for the safety and wellbeing of the community, which allows others to represent themselves as their authentic way of being in the world and to feel respected, and treated with dignity as they participate. 
</p>

<p>
  Knowing this–other people's forms of self-expression might make you uncomfortable or might be against your own moral compass. It is up to each person to participate with what feels consenting to them, and people should feel free to move away from, or distance themselves from things that feel uncomfortable. We also encourage folks to be open minded and lean into the challenge of trying to understand other people's perspectives and experiences, to help broaden your own experiences and perspectives in the environment of the burn.
</p>

<h4>Self Organization</h4>

<p>
  <b>Volunteerism</b>
  <br />
  Wicked Burn is 100% volunteer run. No one gets comp tickets. Everyone is invited to help plan and co-create the vision that becomes Wicked Burn. Everyone can be a part of what exists. Everyone is invited to work, Everyone is invited to play. The planning meetings and committee are open to everyone to join and help share ideas.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Accountability</b>
  <br />
  Wicked Burn fosters an environment of personal and community accountability, where we hold ourselves responsible for our own actions, take responsibility for meeting our own needs, consider how our actions impact others, the event itself, and its impact on the world at large.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Cooperation</b>
  <br />
  Wicked Burn creates an opportunity for people to work together to resolve conflicts with respect for one another, and help to mediate conflicts between others. We seek to keep the event sustainable by inviting people to volunteer to help organize the event, cleaning and caretaking for the land so that we can continue to utilize it for years to come, and with the understanding that all attendees are assuming personal responsibility for conducting themselves in accordance with local, state and federal laws.
