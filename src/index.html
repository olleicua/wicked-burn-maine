<h3>What is Wicked Burn</h3>
<p>
  Wicked Burn is an inclusive community that ignites creativity, self-expression, and community inspired by Burning Man’s 11 Principles. Rooted in Maine’s rustic woods, it’s a collaborative space for art, personal growth, and shared experiences. We are committed to inclusivity, sustainability, and leaving a positive impact while celebrating the transformative power of participation.
